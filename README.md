- 👋 Hi, I’m @NirvanaAchieved
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, games (FPS), anime (action/fantasy/adventure/MMORPG), audiobooks (LitRPG), stocks/options/cryptos, and a million other things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, HTML, JavaScript, C#, and how to effectively use GitHub 😂🤷‍♂️
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, indie ideas, and scripts for the lazy
